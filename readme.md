# WaterSortPuzzle Solver

I got stuck on level 105 of WaterSortPuzzle and wanted to make sure that it was solvable without an extra beaker.

## Inputs

Input files are super flexible, you can use any name for each color as long as they are unique and consistent. Please note:

- a single comma on a line indicates an empty 'beaker'
- reading each line from left to right corresponds to bottom to top of the 'beaker'

## Disclaimer

I really didn't clean this up very much but I just thought I would post it anyway. Some behavior isn't optimal, and I also haven't tested anything thoroughly, mostly due to how hard it is to access levels in the WaterSortPuzzle app.
